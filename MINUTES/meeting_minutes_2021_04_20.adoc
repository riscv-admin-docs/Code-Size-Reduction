= Code size reduction 20th april 2021

C.PUSH/POP/POPRET.E encodings are bad, they overlap
David Horner is concerned about subsets, I'll wait for feedback from Krste before changing them as they relate to what is required or optional in the RVM22 platform

DECBGEZ: analysis of patterns - BNEZ is an easier solution, and Anders will do some more work and we can udpate it next week if he's still happy with that
(PPC instruction DECBGEZ). Note that GCC uses as C.BGEZ/C.BNEZs that's what's currently available

MULI needs a 10-bit immediate following analysis.
Need analysis of added benefit from MULIADD when MULI is already inferred

Why is ADDIADD benefit so high for HUFFBENCH? When Ibrahim releases the analysis script then Paolo Savini can run it
