= Code size reduction Meeting Minutes 2021/04/13

== Zce review

Most of the meeting was spent discussing the way the ISA subsets are defined, and that they are generally confusing.

Zcecm for example is redundant as you'd never specify it in the config string. Zced is a confusing name - better to remove the D.

Action: Tariq - simplify the subsets (*done*)

TBLJAL - the table jump mode is very similar to the xtvt register in CLIC which gives a table of pointers so hopefully won't be a problem for ratification.

C.DECBGEZ - Aners designed it to action to model it in IAR and report the benefit. it does take a lot of encoding space, and the compiled code needs to be 
changed to make use it of, it's not a simple substitution.

Embedded profile - Mark to ask Krste on Friday about inclusion in RVM22.
