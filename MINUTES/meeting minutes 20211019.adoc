= Code-size meeting minutes

Action Tariq: Mark Himelstein suggests putting out another call for benchmarking results.

Action Ibrahim: update the script on github first, it's out of date. The existing contributions also need re-running.

Action Tariq: do a Zce summary slide for the RISC-V summit

Action Tariq: to check for the arch review policy and submit all three proposals individually (they don't all need to go through together).

In the meeting we had a brief look at the three proposed extensions Zcee, Zceb, Zces and the benchmarking results.
Overall the results look pretty good and we're keen to get them submitted.

For the compiler : LLVM is ahead but is generally behind in code-size. GCC development is behind. If a company wants to invest in Zce optimisation in either compiler then that would really help.
